I am Anna Weis, and I am a first-year master's student studying computer engineering. I am currently working in the Min Kao Neuromorphic TENNLab, testing and verifying different neural networks on FPGAs. 
I'm interested in learning more about the data science and digital traces in the context of machine learning as well as how to organize and reproduce such data.
